                </h3>
                <p>
                    Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, computer science, and technology
                    to create machines that perform various tasks autonomously. These robots are often programmed to
                    perform specific tasks, such as assembling products in a factory, assisting surgeons, or even
                    exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industry, healthcare,
                    agriculture, and personal use, leading to innovations that previously relied heavily on manual
                    labor.<br>
                    In recent years, robots with machine learning capabilities have greatly evolved. They are no longer
                    just machines following instructions but autonomous systems capable of learning and interacting
                    with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of
                    robotics is rapidly evolving and playing a critical role in many sectors.

                <h3>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes that previously required human
                    labor The most common types of industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely used in the
                    automotive, electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines can perform tasks with
                    precision, speed, and endurance beyond human capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling,
                    and packaging. <br><br>
                    In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can work in hazardous
                    environments where human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in
                    extreme
                    temperatures. As the demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for maintaining
                    the pace and quality required in modem manufacturing. The future of industrial robots includes
                    increased collaboration between robots and humans, with robots assisting workers in complex tasks
                    that require high-level decision-making.

                    Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both in appearance and
                    functionality. These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such
                    as assisting in healthcare, customer service, and education. The defining characteristic of humanoid
                    robots is their ability to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced
                    algorithms for speech recognition, facial expression interpretation. and decision-making. <br><br>
                    Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO. Sophia. and Atlas. which have
                    been designed for various purposes. from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous
                    tasks in disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part of research and
                    development, where they help scientists better understand human cognition, biomechanics, and social
                    interaction. With continued advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics. humanoid robots
                    are expected to become more autonomous, capable of leaming from experience, and performing
                    increasingly
                    complex tasks in the future.
